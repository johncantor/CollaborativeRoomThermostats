CollaborativeRoomThermostats
============================

Using Arduino-based OpenEnergyMonitor EmonGLCD as thermostats for use with heat pump heating systems.

The energy-efficiency of a home-heating heat pump system is very dependent on its working temperatures. In brief - they like low temperures (on the heat-output side), and like steady-state conditions.

Buffer cylinders are often used to improve matters when there are many heat emitters (radiators or underfloor) that may automatically turn on and off.

Buffer cylinders are far from ideal, and nice to avoid if possible.

A better plan could be to make the individula room thermostats 'collaborate' in some way so that radiators **tend** to all come on together. This can be achieved by several means.
